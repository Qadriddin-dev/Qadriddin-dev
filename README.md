I have extensive experience in PHP development using the Laravel framework and databases such as Postgres and MySQL. My technical stack also includes Git, Docker, and Postman.<br><br>I have been working at Babylon-T for several months now, during which time I have had the opportunity to participate in many backend projects. One of the projects I worked on was the development of an API for a mobile application. In this project, I designed and developed the API, implemented functionality according to requirements, and tested it using Postman.<br><br>I always strive to follow the best development practices, such as writing clean and understandable code, applying SOLID principles, and testing my code. I am also convinced that good communication and teamwork with other team members are key factors in the successful development of projects.<br><br>In my free time, I often engage in self-education and learn new technologies that can be useful in my work.
